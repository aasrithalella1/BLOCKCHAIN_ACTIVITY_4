# Blockchain Activity 4 – Minimal DApp

This repository contains my work for **Activity 4** in the blockchain course.  
The project is a very simple decentralized application (DApp) built with plain HTML and JavaScript.  
The main goal was to connect a wallet, interact with a smart contract, and understand the workflow of deploying a DApp.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `index.html` → front-end page that loads in a browser  
- `.gitignore` → ignores environment files, node_modules, and build artifacts  
- (more files will be added as I expand the project)

---

## 🚀 How I Run It
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aasrithalella1/BLOCKCHAIN_ACTIVITY_4.git


Open the folder on your machine.

Just double-click index.html to open it in the browser.
(For a cleaner setup, I sometimes use a local server with python -m http.server.)

Connect MetaMask when prompted.




🔧 Configuration Needed

RPC URL → provided by instructor

Chain ID → matches the class blockchain network

Contract Address → updated in the script once deployed

(These are not committed; kept local for security.)

📸 Screenshots Checklist


🔑 MetaMask connected (account visible)

🌐 Network successfully added (RPC + Chain ID)

📖 Contract read call showing value

✍️ Contract write transaction confirmed with tx hash

📜 Git log + repo page showing commit history


📘 Key Learnings

✅ Initializing Git repos and pushing from Windows PowerShell

✅ Protecting secrets with .gitignore

✅ Adding MetaMask custom networks

✅ Making read & write calls from a DApp front-end
