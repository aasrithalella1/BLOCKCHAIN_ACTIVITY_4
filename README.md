# Blockchain Activity 4 – Minimal DApp

This repository contains my work for **Activity 4** in the blockchain course.  
The project is a very simple decentralized application (DApp) built with plain HTML and JavaScript.  
The main goal was to connect a wallet, interact with a smart contract, and understand the workflow of deploying a DApp.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `index.html` → front-end page that loads in a browser  
- `.gitignore` → ignores environment files, node_modules, and build artifacts  
- (more files will be added as I expand the project)

## 🚀 How I Run It
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aasrithalella1/BLOCKCHAIN_ACTIVITY_4.git


Open the folder on your machine.

Double-click `index.html` to launch in a browser.  
*(Optional: run `python -m http.server` and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).)*  

Connect MetaMask when prompted.

## 🔧 Configuration Needed
- **RPC URL** — provided by instructor  
- **Chain ID** — matches the class blockchain network  
- **Contract Address** — added in the script once deployed  

> I don’t commit private values; they stay local for security.

## 📸 Screenshots Checklist
- 🔑 MetaMask connected (account visible)  
- 🌐 Network added (RPC + Chain ID)  
- 📖 Contract **read** call showing a value  
- ✍️ Contract **write** transaction confirmed with a tx hash  
- 📜 Git log + this GitHub page showing commit history

## 📘 What I Learned
- 🖥 Initializing a Git repo and pushing from Windows PowerShell  
- 🛡 Using `.gitignore` to protect secrets like `.env`  
- 🌐 Adding a custom network in MetaMask  
- 🔗 Making read/write calls from a browser DApp
