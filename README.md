# Blockchain Activity 4 – Minimal DApp

This repository contains my work for **Activity 4** in the blockchain course.  
The project is a very simple decentralized application (DApp) built with plain HTML and JavaScript.  
The main goal was to connect a wallet, interact with a smart contract, and understand the workflow of deploying a DApp.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `index.html` → front-end page that loads in a browser  
- `.gitignore` → ignores environment files, node_modules, and build artifacts  
- (more files will be added as I expand the project)

## 🚀 How I Run It
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aasrithalella1/BLOCKCHAIN_ACTIVITY_4.git


Open the folder on your machine.

Just double-click index.html to open it in the browser.
(For a cleaner setup, I sometimes use a local server with python -m http.server.)

Connect MetaMask when prompted.
